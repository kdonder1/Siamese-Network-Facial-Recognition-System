# Siamese-Network-Facial-Recognition-System
## Final Project for DIDA 340 - Introduction to Deep Learning

This project implements a Siamese neural network for facial recognition using metric learning. Instead of classifying faces into fixed identities, the model learns embeddings that measure similarity between images, enabling accurate identity verification without retraining. The project also explores ethical considerations surrounding real-world deployment of facial recognition systems.

Included in this repository is our final presentation.

Made in collaboration with two other students.
